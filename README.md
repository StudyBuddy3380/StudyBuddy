This Project was made with Android Studio. Because of how android studio creates files, it is too large to upload directly to github. To run the project: 
1. Run Android Studio(https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) 
2. Open a new project. 
3. Copy the java and XML files into the project. 
4. Run the project either through the given emulators or on a physical Android device.
